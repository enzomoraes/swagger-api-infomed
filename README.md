# Swagger/OpenApi 3.0 API INFOMED
OpenApi/Swagger documentation of an API built whilst cursing Software Engineering 7th semester - UFMS

## What was Built
A mobile app that has a manual of steps to follow according to our customers's requirements, that needed a back-end api to consume, wich provides authentication through Bearer tokens - JWT, a database set of medicines with their properties and user management.

### Some of the features includes
- Email sending on user activation/deactivation using Sendgrid
- Authentication Using JWT

## Why was Built
In my two last semesters in my Software enginnering course, we have somthing we call 'Núcleo de práticas de software', one translation would be 'Software practices', where we are matched with a real customer whom presents it's proposal for a software that fulfills its necessities.
Then, we contact the customer and come up with the requirements.
Then, our team got to choose what technologies we will use, what processes we will do and so on.
Finally we start building the software.

## How was Built

#### Our team decided to use Agile Methodologies
- Scrum, daily meetings, sprint reviews, sprint planning

#### For the Front-end
- Vue.js (Quasar framework)

#### For the Back-end
- An API built in Node.js using Express
- http://infomed-api.herokuapp.com/

#### Testing
- We use jest


I created this repository with the intention of practicing English writing and Swagger/OpenAPI documentation. 
Once I was responsible for the Back-end API, I thought we should have a way to the front-end know what requisitions should be made and what to expect from it. For authorial rights I can't share the application source code but the .yaml file.
